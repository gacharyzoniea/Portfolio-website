                    <p>I've always had a passion for computers and machines. In school, I wasn't sure how to turn this passion into a career until I joined my school's IT internship program. 
                        Instantly, I fell in love with working with computers. Now, I'm pursuing my degree at Grove City College, set to graduate in spring 2024. 
                        I enjoy unraveling the inner workings of computers and their languages. I'm tenacious, loyal, funny, and eager for any employment opportunity. 
                        Feel free to reach out to me through my social media accounts, email, or the contact messenger on this site. Thanks for visiting! </p>
